Hey there, Iâ€™m Matt Teixeira; a full-stack developer. Currently, I work in the environmental field as a consultant scientist and data analyst.

I am passionate about creating excellent software that improves
              the lives of those around me. I specialize in developng tools for
              niche processes and applications for individuals and
              small-businesses. With each project, my aim is to provide a
              solution for the problem at hand. What could your team accomplish
              with a developer at your side?
